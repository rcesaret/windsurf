# Knowledge Directory

This directory is intended to store domain-specific knowledge relevant to the project. This can include technical papers, summaries of key algorithms, or explanations of complex business logic.

**Instructions for End-User:** Populate this directory with any specialized knowledge the AI will need to understand your project's domain. This is distinct from the `glossary.md` as it is meant for in-depth conceptual explanations, not just definitions.
