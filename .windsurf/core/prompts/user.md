# User Prompt Template

**Instructions for End-User:** Use this template as a guide for structuring your requests to Cascade. Providing clear, structured information will yield the best results.

## 1. Goal / Objective

*(Clearly state what you want to achieve. What is the high-level goal?)*

**Example:** "Add a new feature that allows users to export their data to a CSV file."

## 2. Context / Background

*(Provide any necessary context. Are there specific files, functions, or database tables involved? Are there related issues or previous discussions?)*

**Example:** "This feature should be added to the `UserProfile` page. The data is stored in the `users` and `user_profiles` tables."

## 3. Specific Requirements / Acceptance Criteria

*(List the specific, testable requirements that must be met for the task to be considered complete.)*

**Example:**
"- A 'Download CSV' button should be present on the user profile page.
- Clicking the button should trigger a download of a file named `export.csv`.
- The CSV must contain the user's `id`, `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name`."
