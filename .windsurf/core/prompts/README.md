# Prompts Directory

This directory contains the core prompt files that form the foundation of the AI's instructions.

## Files

-   **`system.md`**: The main system prompt. It sets the AI's overall context, constraints, and high-level directives. It is the first and most important instruction file.
-   **`user.md`**: A template or base for user-provided prompts, outlining how users should frame their requests for optimal results.
