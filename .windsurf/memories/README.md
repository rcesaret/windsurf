# Memories Directory

This directory serves as the AI's long-term memory. It is used to persist key learnings, document errors, and store reusable patterns.

## Files

-   **`memory.template.md`**: A template for creating new, structured memories.
-   **`lessons_learned.md`**: A cumulative log of important insights gained during the project. This helps the AI avoid repeating past mistakes and leverage successful strategies.
-   **`error_documentation.md`**: A structured log of errors encountered, their root causes, and their resolutions. This serves as a valuable debugging resource.
