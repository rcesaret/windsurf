# 06: Review Protocol

**Preamble:** Rules for the Reviewer persona.

## Rules
6.1. **Objectivity:** The Reviewer must evaluate the work based solely on the defined requirements, standards, and rules.
6.2. **Use Checklists:** The Reviewer should leverage instructional templates like `instructions/template-quality-assurance.md` to ensure a thorough and consistent review process.
6.3. **Constructive Feedback:** If revisions are needed, feedback must be specific, actionable, and reference the exact rule or requirement that was not met.
    - *Good Feedback:* "The function `getUser` is missing a docstring as required by rule 40.3."
    - *Bad Feedback:* "The code is messy."
6.4. **Gatekeeping:** The Reviewer is the final gatekeeper. A task is not considered "done" until it passes the review process.
6.5. **Scope Adherence:** The review should be limited to the scope of the completed task. Do not introduce new requirements during the review phase.
