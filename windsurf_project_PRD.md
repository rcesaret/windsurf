### 1.3 Scope
*   **In Scope:** This PRD covers all features, tasks, tools, documentation, and deliverables explicitly specified within Phases 1 (Foundation Hardening), 2 (Memory & Context Optimization), and 3 (Developer Experience & Usability) of the `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`. This includes the creation of new files, modification of existing ones, development of CLI tools, establishment of CI/CD pipelines, and generation of associated documentation.
*   **Out of Scope:** Phase 4 (Security, Governance & Advanced Features) as detailed in `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md` is not covered by this PRD and will be addressed in a subsequent project phase and its corresponding PRD. Additionally, any features listed in Appendix A (Deferred Features) of `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md` are explicitly out of scope for this implementation cycle.

### 1.4 Target User
The primary target user for the enhanced IMA system is the **Cascade AI agent**. The system is designed to augment Cascade's capabilities, making it more efficient, reliable, and context-aware. Secondary beneficiaries are the **human developers** who interact with Cascade; they will experience improved AI assistance, better project maintainability, and more streamlined workflows due to the IMA enhancements.

### 1.5 Guiding Principles
The development process will adhere to the following guiding principles, derived from `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md` and `NEW_PATH_FORWARD.md`:
1.  **Immediate Value:** Prioritize changes that solve current pain points and deliver tangible benefits quickly to the AI and human users.
2.  **Incremental Implementation:** Structure work into manageable, iterative phases that build upon each other, allowing for stable progress and continuous feedback.
3.  **Minimal User Burden:** Favor enhancements that automate processes or simplify workflows over those requiring significant new learning or manual configuration from human users.
4.  **Positive Performance Impact:** Focus on optimizations that demonstrably improve system responsiveness, AI reasoning speed, token efficiency, and overall scalability.
5.  **Maintainability:** Ensure that all changes contribute to a more robust, auditable, and easily managed IMA system in the long term, facilitating future enhancements and troubleshooting.

## 2. Phase 1: Foundation Hardening

**Overall Objective for Phase 1:** To solidify the core architecture of the IMA, automate critical validation processes, formalize operational protocols, and improve the initial user experience. This phase establishes a robust and reliable foundation upon which all future enhancements will be built.

### 2.1 Formalize Operational Mode State Machine
*   **Objective:** To define clear, unambiguous, and machine-readable operational modes for the Cascade AI, along with the permissible transitions between these modes. This will enhance AI predictability, control, and auditability.
*   **Rationale:** A formal state machine for operational modes is crucial for ensuring consistent AI behavior across diverse tasks and aligns with the structured, protocol-driven approach advocated in all strategic planning documents for the IMA.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Create `modes.yaml`:** A new configuration file shall be created at `.windsurf/config/modes.yaml`. This file must contain the complete YAML structure as specified in Section 1.1 of `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`, defining all modes (ARCHITECT, PLANNER, EXECUTOR, REVIEWER, SECURITY), their descriptions, allowed/forbidden actions, entry/exit conditions, and valid transitions.
    2.  **Update Meta-Rules:** The existing meta-rules document, `.windsurf/rules/01-meta-rules.md`, shall be modified to directly reference the new `modes.yaml` configuration file. The updated rule must mandate adherence to the defined modes, their transition protocols, and require explicit mode declaration by the AI.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The file `.windsurf/config/modes.yaml` exists, is syntactically valid YAML, and its content precisely matches the specification in `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`.
    2.  The file `.windsurf/rules/01-meta-rules.md` correctly references `@.windsurf/config/modes.yaml` and its content is updated to enforce the new mode management protocol.
    3.  Observed AI behavior during task execution demonstrates strict adherence to the defined operational modes and their specified transition rules. Any mode change is explicitly declared and justified.

### 2.2 Continuous Rule Validation Pipeline
*   **Objective:** To automate the validation of all IMA rule files (in `.windsurf/rules/` and `.windsurf/instructions/`) to proactively prevent syntax errors, broken file references, structural inconsistencies, and deviations from best practices, thereby mitigating "rule drift."
*   **Rationale:** As identified in `o3_high_project_review.md` and reinforced in subsequent strategic documents, automated validation is essential for guaranteeing the integrity of the IMA's rule base and maintaining consistent, reliable AI behavior over time.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Develop `rule-lint` CLI Tool:** A command-line interface tool, named `rule-lint`, shall be developed (e.g., in Node.js as `rule-lint.js` or Python as `rule-lint.py`) and located at `.windsurf/tools/`. This script must perform the following validation checks on all `.md` files within the specified rule directories:
        *   Validate YAML front-matter against a defined schema (ensuring presence and basic type-correctness of `id`, `activation_keywords`, `priority`, `scope`, etc.).
        *   Check for consistent heading structures (e.g., H1 for title, H2 for major sections) and sequential numbering where applicable.
        *   Verify that all `@` file references (e.g., `@.windsurf/config/modes.yaml`) point to existing files within the project's `.windsurf/` directory.
        *   Flag the use of weak or ambiguous language (e.g., "should", "could", "might", "consider") and suggest assertive, clear language ("MUST", "SHALL", "WILL", "MUST NOT").
        *   Identify broken internal Markdown links (e.g., `[link](#section-header)` where no such `section-header` anchor exists in the current file).
        *   Optionally, check for overly long lines or paragraphs that might impede readability.
    2.  **Create GitHub Action for Rule Linting:** A new GitHub Actions workflow file shall be created at `.github/workflows/rule-lint.yml`. This workflow must automatically trigger the `rule-lint` tool on every push and pull_request event that modifies files within the `.windsurf/**/*.md` paths.
    3.  **Add Status Badge to READMEs:** A status badge indicating the result of the latest `rule-lint` execution on the main branch shall be added to the main project `README.md` and the `.windsurf/README.md`.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The `rule-lint` tool is executable and correctly identifies all specified categories of issues in sample rule files.
    2.  The GitHub Action defined in `rule-lint.yml` triggers on relevant push/PR events, executes the `rule-lint` tool, and accurately reports success or failure status.
    3.  The status badges in `README.md` and `.windsurf/README.md` are present and dynamically reflect the outcome of the `rule-lint` CI check.

### 2.3 Adopt Digital TMP Task & Plan System
*   **Objective:** To standardize the format for `TASKS.md` (master task backlog) and individual `.plan.md` files (detailed execution plans for complex tasks) to ensure they are machine-readable, consistently structured, and contain all necessary context for the AI to execute tasks effectively.
*   **Rationale:** The Digital Task Management Protocol (TMP) format, as detailed in `TASKS_example.md` and promoted in strategic reports, provides the necessary structure for predictable task definition, automated parsing, and streamlined AI-driven workflow management.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Update `planning/tasks/TASKS.md`:** The content of `.windsurf/planning/tasks/TASKS.md` shall be replaced with a template that defines and exemplifies the Digital TMP v2.3 schema. This template must include the full schema definition as a reference and at least one example task (e.g., `P1.W1.A1 - Formalize Operational Mode State Machine`) fully adhering to this schema, as specified in Section 1.3 of `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`.
    2.  **Update `planning/plans/PLAN.template.md`:** The plan template file, `.windsurf/planning/plans/PLAN.template.md`, shall be updated to follow the standard multi-stage format (Context Ingestion, Preparation, Execution, Final Validation) suitable for AI processing and detailed task execution, as specified in Section 1.3 of `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The file `.windsurf/planning/tasks/TASKS.md` contains the Digital TMP v2.3 schema definition and example tasks that strictly adhere to this schema.
    2.  The file `.windsurf/planning/plans/PLAN.template.md` provides a usable, structured template with all specified stages, suitable for generating detailed execution plans for the AI.

### 2.4 Introduce Basic CLI Tooling & Improve DX
*   **Objective:** To reduce manual effort, prevent common errors during IMA setup and task management, and generally improve the developer experience by automating routine tasks.
*   **Rationale:** A simple, effective Command Line Interface (CLI) enhances developer productivity, ensures consistency in IMA operations, and lowers the barrier to adoption, as recommended in the O3 review and various strategic reports.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Develop `.windsurf/tools/cli.js` (or `.py`):** A CLI tool shall be developed. This tool must support the following sub-commands as detailed in Section 1.4 of `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`:
        *   `init`: Initializes a new `.windsurf` directory in the current project by copying files from a template directory. It should prevent overwriting an existing `.windsurf` directory and provide guidance on next steps.
        *   `next-task`: Reads and parses `.windsurf/planning/tasks/TASKS.md`, identifies the highest priority pending task with no pending dependencies, and generates/updates `.windsurf/planning/active_context.md` with its details. It should also handle task status updates (e.g., to 'in_progress').
        *   `validate`: Serves as a master validation command that invokes other validation scripts, including `rule-lint` and potentially schema checks for `TASKS.md` and `modes.yaml`.
    2.  **Add `package.json` for Tooling (if Node.js):** If the CLI tool is developed using Node.js, a `package.json` file shall be created in `.windsurf/tools/` to manage dependencies (e.g., `commander`, `fs-extra`, `js-yaml`).
    3.  **Create `templates_for_init/` directory:** A directory named `templates_for_init/` shall be created within `.windsurf/`. This directory must be populated with the baseline version of all essential IMA files and directories that the `windsurf init` command will copy to a new project (e.g., `config/modes.yaml`, `rules/`, `context/`, `planning/tasks/TASKS.md` template).
    4.  **Create `integration_issue_stubs.md`:** A file named `integration_issue_stubs.md` shall be created at the root of the project. This file must contain ready-to-use GitHub issue templates for common IMA enhancements and integrations, as specified in `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`, to guide community or team contributions.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The `windsurf init` command successfully initializes a new, functional `.windsurf` directory structure from the `templates_for_init/` directory.
    2.  The `windsurf next-task` command correctly identifies the next appropriate task from `TASKS.md` and generates a comprehensive `active_context.md` file.
    3.  The `windsurf validate` command successfully executes all relevant validation scripts (e.g., `rule-lint`) and reports a consolidated status.
    4.  The `integration_issue_stubs.md` file exists at the project root and contains the specified GitHub issue templates.
    5.  If Node.js is used, `package.json` correctly lists all necessary dependencies for the CLI tool.

## 3. Phase 2: Memory & Context Optimization

**Overall Objective for Phase 2:** To significantly enhance the IMA's ability to manage, retrieve, and utilize its vast knowledge base (memories, documentation, etc.) efficiently. This phase focuses on ensuring the scalability of the IMA and the relevance of information provided to the AI, critical for preventing context window overflow and improving the signal-to-noise ratio in AI inputs.

### 3.1 Implement Robust Memory Indexing & Search
*   **Objective:** To enable fast, accurate, and contextually relevant retrieval of information from the IMA's memory stores (especially `lessons_learned.md`, `error_documentation.md`, and files in `knowledge/`).
*   **Rationale:** As the IMA accumulates knowledge, an efficient and intelligent retrieval mechanism becomes paramount for AI performance and the relevance of its actions. This directly addresses recommendations from multiple strategic reviews for improved knowledge management and accessibility.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Develop Memory Indexing Script (`.windsurf/tools/index_memory.py`):** A Python script shall be developed to perform the following actions:
        *   Recursively scan all `.md` files within `.windsurf/memories/` and `.windsurf/knowledge/`.
        *   Extract key metadata from YAML front-matter (e.g., `id`, `title`, `keywords`, `related_tasks`, `created_date`, `summary`).
        *   Extract the main textual content, stripping Markdown for cleaner indexing.
        *   Implement basic keyword extraction from the content (e.g., using TF-IDF or a simple frequency counter, excluding common stop words).
        *   Populate or update a SQLite database located at `.windsurf/db/memory_index.db`. This database must have a table with columns for file path, ID, title, summary, extracted keywords, full cleaned content, and last indexed timestamp. It must utilize SQLite's FTS5 extension for full-text search on title, summary, keywords, and content fields.
    2.  **Develop Memory Search Script (`.windsurf/tools/search_memory.py`):** A Python script shall be developed to:
        *   Accept a query string and optional filters (date range, keywords, source directory).
        *   Connect to `.windsurf/db/memory_index.db`.
        *   Perform a ranked FTS5 search, boosting scores for title/keyword matches.
        *   Return the top N matching memory entries (file path, title, summary, relevant snippet).
        *   Output results in a structured format (JSON or human-readable summary).
    3.  **Integrate Indexing into CI/CD:** The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` or a new `memory_management.yml`) must be updated to run `python .windsurf/tools/index_memory.py` whenever files in `.windsurf/memories/` or `.windsurf/knowledge/` are modified on `main` or `develop` branches.
    4.  **Update Rules for Memory Access (`.windsurf/rules/02-memory-access.md`):** This rule file must be updated to instruct the AI to:
        *   Prioritize using the `search_memory.py` tool for finding relevant information.
        *   Fall back to direct file reading only if targeted search yields no results or a file is explicitly referenced.
        *   Formulate concise search queries based on current task context.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  `index_memory.py` successfully creates and updates `memory_index.db` with content from specified directories, including extracted keywords and metadata.
    2.  `search_memory.py` accurately returns relevant, ranked search results from `memory_index.db` based on various query types.
    3.  The CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers `index_memory.py` upon changes to memory or knowledge files, keeping the index reasonably up-to-date.
    4.  The AI, when needing information from memory, demonstrates use of `search_memory.py` as its primary retrieval method, constructing effective search queries.

### 3.2 Implement Context Optimization Strategies
*   **Objective:** To intelligently manage the AI's context window, ensuring it stays within token limits while maximizing the relevance and density of information provided for the current task.
*   **Rationale:** An advanced IMA must effectively manage the finite resource of context length. This is a recurring theme in strategic reviews (`Doc08`, `NEW_PATH_FORWARD.md`) and is crucial for enabling the AI to handle complex tasks without performance degradation or loss of critical information.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Add Context Pruning Rule for Large Documents:** Instruction files for operational modes that typically ingest large documents (e.g., `.windsurf/instructions/architect-mode.md`, `.windsurf/instructions/planner-mode.md`) shall be modified to include a rule for context pruning. This rule must instruct the AI: "Before ingesting any single document estimated to be larger than 10,000 tokens (or a configurable threshold), you MUST first perform a targeted summarization pass. Your summary should extract key entities, architectural decisions, constraints, requirements, or any information directly pertinent to your current task. Use this summary as the primary context for that document, only referring to the full document if the summary proves insufficient and explicitly noting why."
    2.  **Create Memory Compaction Workflow (`MAINTENANCE` Mode Task):**
        *   A new operational mode, `MAINTENANCE`, shall be added to `.windsurf/config/modes.yaml` with appropriate permissions for reading and writing to memory files and invoking tools.
        *   A recurring task (e.g., `P2.M1.S1 - Monthly Memory Compaction`) shall be defined in `TASKS.md` for this `MAINTENANCE` mode. This task will instruct the AI to:
            *   Read (or search via `search_memory.py`) `.windsurf/memories/error_documentation.md` and `.windsurf/memories/lessons_learned.md`.
            *   Identify recurring themes, common error patterns, or frequently applied solutions.
            *   Synthesize these into a new, concise file: `.windsurf/memories/synthesized_insights.md`, structured with clear headings and references back to original entries.
            *   Ensure `index_memory.py` also indexes this synthesized file.
        *   The `.windsurf/rules/02-memory-access.md` rule shall be updated to suggest checking `synthesized_insights.md` first for common issues.
    3.  **Implement `active_context.md` Generation in CLI:** The `windsurf next-task` CLI command (from Phase 1.4) shall be enhanced to automatically generate a `.windsurf/planning/active_context.md` file. This file must:
        *   Include the full details of the selected task from `TASKS.md`.
        *   Fetch and include the content of files listed in the task's `context_files` (or summaries if they are very large, using a helper script or AI summarization pass if feasible).
        *   Run a preliminary search of `memory_index.db` using keywords from the task description and include the top 1-2 most relevant results.
        *   Instruct the AI to use this `active_context.md` as its primary input for starting the task.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The AI, when faced with large documents in relevant modes, demonstrates summarization behavior as per the context pruning rule.
    2.  The `MAINTENANCE` mode is defined, the memory compaction task is present in `TASKS.md`, and the AI can (when instructed) generate or update `.windsurf/memories/synthesized_insights.md` which is then indexed.
    3.  The `windsurf next-task` command generates `active_context.md` containing all specified components: task details, context file contents/summaries, and preliminary memory search results.

### 3.3 Enhance CI/CD and Version Control Practices
*   **Objective:** To improve the robustness and reliability of the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for IMA-related tools and scripts, and to formalize version control practices for the IMA itself.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures higher quality for all contributions to the IMA and aligns the project with professional DevOps standards, as recommended in various strategic reviews. Mature CI/CD and version control are essential for collaborative development and long-term maintainability.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Implement Matrix Testing in CI:** The primary CI workflow (e.g., a new `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or an enhanced existing one) shall be updated to use a build matrix. This matrix should facilitate testing of IMA CLI tools (e.g., `rule-lint.js`, `cli.js`) and other core scripts (e.g., `index_memory.py`, `search_memory.py`) across multiple supported versions of Node.js and/or Python, and potentially across different operating systems (Linux, Windows) to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
    2.  **Document and Enforce Branch Protection Rules:** A dedicated section or a new file, `.windsurf/rules/50-version-control.md` (to be created if it doesn't exist), shall be established. This document must explicitly detail the branch protection rules configured in the GitHub repository for critical branches like `main` and `develop`. Examples include: "Require Pull Request review before merging by at least one other designated team member," "Require all status checks (e.g., rule-linting, automated tests for tools) to pass before merging," and "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed."
    3.  **Adopt and Enforce Semantic Commit/PR Labeling:**
        *   The project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (to be created at the project root or within `.windsurf/` if it doesn't exist) and the `.windsurf/rules/50-version-control.md` document shall be updated to mandate the use of semantic commit messages (e.g., following the Conventional Commits specification: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`). Clear examples must be provided.
        *   The use of standardized Pull Request (PR) labels (e.g., `type: bug`, `type: feature`, `scope: rules`, `scope: cli`, `priority: high`) shall be recommended or mandated to improve PR organization and searchability.
        *   Consideration should be given to adding a GitHub Action (e.g., `commitlint`) to the CI pipeline to automatically enforce the semantic commit message format on PRs targeting `main` or `develop` branches.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The CI pipeline successfully executes tests for IMA tools and scripts across the defined matrix of Node.js/Python versions and operating systems.
    2.  The `.windsurf/rules/50-version-control.md` document accurately reflects the branch protection rules enforced in GitHub for `main` and `develop` branches.
    3.  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `50-version-control.md` clearly define the semantic commit message format and PR labeling conventions.
    4.  Ideally, a CI check (e.g., `commitlint`) is in place and correctly validates commit message formats on PRs.

## 4. Phase 3: Developer Experience & Usability

**Overall Objective for Phase 3:** To significantly lower the barrier to entry for using and customizing the Windsurf IMA, and to provide developers with powerful tools and resources that streamline their interaction with the AI and the IMA framework. This phase is focused on making the IMA not just powerful, but also accessible and user-friendly.

### 4.1 Comprehensive Onboarding & Customization Guide
*   **Objective:** To provide new users with a smooth onboarding experience and clear, actionable guidance on how to customize the IMA to their specific project needs.
*   **Rationale:** Effective onboarding and clear customization instructions are critical for user adoption and for empowering developers to leverage the full potential of the IMA. This addresses a key aspect of developer experience highlighted in strategic planning.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Enhance `windsurf init` for Interactive Onboarding:** The `windsurf init` CLI command (from Phase 1.4) shall be enhanced to include an interactive setup process. This process should:
        *   Prompt the user for basic project information (e.g., project name, primary programming language, AI model to be used if known).
        *   Use this information to populate placeholders in the template files (e.g., in `README.md`, example rule files, or a new `.windsurf/project_context.yaml` file).
        *   Offer to initialize a basic Git repository if one doesn't already exist.
        *   Provide clear instructions on the next steps, pointing to the `customization-guide.md`.
    2.  **Create `.windsurf/instructions/customization-guide.md`:** A new, comprehensive Markdown document shall be created. This guide must detail:
        *   The purpose and typical content of each key file and directory within the `.windsurf/` structure (e.g., `rules/`, `instructions/`, `memories/`, `config/modes.yaml`, `planning/tasks/TASKS.md`).
        *   Step-by-step instructions on how to adapt the IMA for different project types or AI personas (e.g., "For a Python web development project, consider adding these specific rules...").
        *   Guidance on writing effective rules, instructions, and memory entries, including examples of good and bad practices.
        *   Instructions on how to use the provided CLI tools (`windsurf next-task`, `windsurf validate`, etc.).
        *   Best practices for maintaining and extending the IMA over time.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The `windsurf init` command offers an interactive setup flow that successfully populates project-specific placeholders in the initialized IMA files.
    2.  The `.windsurf/instructions/customization-guide.md` file exists and provides comprehensive, clear, and actionable guidance covering all specified topics, enabling a new user to effectively adapt the IMA.

### 4.2 Advanced IDE Integration (VS Code Focus)
*   **Objective:** To provide developers with a seamless and productive experience when working with IMA files directly within their Integrated Development Environment (IDE), with an initial focus on Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
*   **Rationale:** Deep IDE integration significantly reduces context switching, improves workflow efficiency, and makes IMA development more intuitive. This is a key component of enhancing the overall developer experience.
*   **Requirements (Iterative Approach):** Development will proceed iteratively, starting with basic features and progressing to more advanced integrations.
    1.  **Basic IDE Features (VS Code):**
        *   **Syntax Highlighting:** Develop or adapt a VS Code extension to provide syntax highlighting for IMA-specific Markdown conventions (e.g., `@` file references, rule front-matter, task list syntax in `TASKS.md`).
        *   **Snippets:** Create a set of VS Code snippets for common IMA constructs (e.g., new rule template, new task entry, mode definition block in `modes.yaml`).
    2.  **CLI Integration & Linting (VS Code):**
        *   **Command Palette Integration:** Expose the `windsurf` CLI commands (`init`, `next-task`, `validate`) through the VS Code Command Palette for easy access without leaving the IDE.
        *   **Inline `rule-lint` Feedback:** Integrate the `rule-lint` tool (from Phase 1.2) to provide real-time or on-save linting feedback directly within the editor for `.md` files in `.windsurf/rules/` and `.windsurf/instructions/`. Errors and warnings should be displayed inline and in the 'Problems' panel.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A VS Code extension (or configuration for an existing Markdown extension) provides accurate syntax highlighting for IMA-specific Markdown elements.
    2.  A collection of useful VS Code snippets for IMA development is available and functional.
    3.  `windsurf` CLI commands can be successfully invoked from the VS Code Command Palette.
    4.  The `rule-lint` tool provides inline diagnostics (errors/warnings) within VS Code for IMA rule and instruction files, updating on save or through a command.

### 4.3 Automated Documentation Site
*   **Objective:** To automatically generate a searchable, navigable, and user-friendly online documentation site from the Markdown files within the `.windsurf/` directory, ensuring that IMA documentation is always up-to-date and easily accessible.
*   **Rationale:** Centralized, well-organized, and easily browsable documentation is essential for both new and experienced users of the IMA. Automating its generation from source files ensures consistency and reduces the manual effort of maintaining separate documentation.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  **Develop Documentation Generation Tool (`.windsurf/tools/docs_generator.py`):** A Python script shall be developed to:
        *   Use a static site generator library (e.g., MkDocs with the Material theme, or Sphinx).
        *   Recursively scan the `.windsurf/` directory (or a configured subset like `.windsurf/rules/`, `.windsurf/instructions/`, `.windsurf/planning/`) for `.md` files.
        *   Organize the found files into a logical navigation structure for the site, potentially using front-matter metadata (e.g., `nav_order`, `category`) or directory structure to infer hierarchy.
        *   Convert Markdown content to HTML, preserving formatting, code blocks, and internal links.
        *   Generate a static HTML site in a designated output directory (e.g., `docs_site/`).
    2.  **Create `.windsurf/docs/` Directory (if needed for generator config):** If the chosen static site generator requires a specific input directory structure or configuration files (e.g., `mkdocs.yml`), this directory shall be created and populated accordingly within `.windsurf/`.
    3.  **Implement CI/CD Workflow for Documentation Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`):** A new GitHub Actions workflow shall be created to:
        *   Trigger on pushes to the `main` branch (or `develop`).
        *   Execute the `docs_generator.py` script to build the static documentation site.
        *   Deploy the generated site to GitHub Pages.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The `docs_generator.py` script successfully builds a complete, static HTML documentation site from the `.windsurf/` Markdown files.
    2.  The generated documentation site is well-structured, easily navigable, searchable, and accurately renders the content of the source Markdown files.
    3.  The `deploy-docs.yml` GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and deploys the documentation site to GitHub Pages upon relevant branch updates.

## 5. Success Metrics

The success of Phases 1-3 of the Windsurf IMA enhancement project will be measured by the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and qualitative feedback:
*   **Reduced Task Start Time for Cascade:** A measurable decrease in the time it takes for Cascade to understand and begin executing a new complex task, attributable to improved `active_context.md` generation and better memory retrieval.
*   **Increased AI Behavior Consistency:** A reduction in unexpected or off-protocol AI behaviors, as evidenced by adherence to `modes.yaml` and rule validations from `rule-lint`.
*   **Reduced IMA Configuration Errors:** A high pass rate for the `rule-lint` CI checks, indicating fewer structural or referential errors in IMA rule and instruction files.
*   **Positive Developer Feedback:** Qualitative feedback gathered through surveys or direct interaction with human developers indicating satisfaction with the IMA's usability, tooling (CLI, IDE integration), and documentation.
*   **Successful Completion of Deliverables:** All features and artifacts specified in this PRD for Phases 1-3 are completed, functional, and meet their acceptance criteria.
*   **Improved Context Relevance & Token Efficiency:** Observable improvements in the relevance of information presented to the AI, and a reduction in unnecessary token usage due to context optimization strategies (summarization, targeted search).

## 6. Assumptions

The successful execution of this PRD relies on the following assumptions:
*   **Cascade AI Capabilities:** The Cascade AI agent possesses the necessary capabilities to understand and execute the tasks outlined in this PRD, including file manipulation, tool execution, and adherence to complex rule sets.
*   **Development Environment:** The development and execution environment supports Node.js and/or Python for the CLI tools and scripts specified.
*   **CI/CD Infrastructure:** GitHub Actions is available and can be configured to run the required CI/CD workflows for linting, testing, indexing, and documentation deployment.
*   **IDE Focus:** Visual Studio Code is the primary target for advanced IDE integration features in Phase 3.

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                      | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Technical Complexity of Implementation**| Medium     | High   | Phased implementation with clear deliverables per phase; thorough unit and integration testing for all tools; iterative refinement based on testing. |
| **`rule-lint` Tool Complexity/Speed**   | Medium     | Medium | Modular design for `rule-lint`; prioritize essential checks first; optimize performance iteratively; allow configuration to disable slower checks. |
| **Memory Search Relevance/Accuracy**      | Medium     | High   | Iterative refinement of indexing (keyword extraction, weighting) and search algorithms; provide clear guidance to AI on formulating effective queries. |
| **Scope Creep**                           | Medium     | High   | Strict adherence to the features defined in this PRD and the `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`; formal change request process for any deviations. |
| **User Adoption of New Tooling/Processes**| Low        | Medium | Comprehensive documentation (`customization-guide.md`); interactive onboarding (`windsurf init`); intuitive CLI design; clear benefits communication. |

## 8. Future Considerations (Out of Scope)

The following items are considered out of scope for the implementation detailed in this PRD but are noted for future planning and development cycles:
*   **Phase 4 Implementation:** All features and objectives detailed under "Phase 4: Security, Governance & Advanced Features" in `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`.
*   **Deferred Features:** Any items explicitly listed in "Appendix A: Deferred Features" of `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`, such as multi-agent communication protocols or blockchain-based audit trails.
*   **Advanced AI-Driven IMA Self-Optimization:** Capabilities beyond the defined memory compaction task, such as AI-automated rule generation, dynamic context adjustment based on real-time performance, or predictive pre-fetching of relevant information.
*   **Support for IDEs other than VS Code:** While foundational tools are language-agnostic, advanced IDE integration beyond VS Code will require separate efforts.
