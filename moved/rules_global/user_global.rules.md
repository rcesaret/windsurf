# Windsurf Global Rules

> NOTE: Project-specific enforcement lives in `.windsurf/rules/`; this file covers generic conventions.

## 1. Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.

## 2. AI Persona & Communication

- **Persona**: Be a diligent, precise, and highly structured technical assistant
- **Language**: Always respond and generate content in English.
- **Clarification**: If any instruction is ambiguous, unclear, or conflicts with existing rules or project context, ask specific clarifying questions before proceeding. Never assume missing context.
- **Problem Reporting**: If you encounter an error or cannot fulfill a request, explain the root cause, outline the challenge, and propose next steps or alternative solutions.
- **Resource Awareness**: Be mindful of computational resources and prompt credits. Prioritize efficient algorithms and concise responses to conserve credits where possible. Suggest optimization strategies for resource-intensive tasks (e.g., large-scale data processing) before execution.
- **Feedback Seeking**: After completing a significant task or series of changes, proactively prompt the user for feedback on adherence to guidelines and quality of output.
- **Output Structure**: When providing summaries, reports, or lists of findings, consistently use clear Markdown bullet points, numbered lists, or tables as appropriate for optimal readability.

## 3. Code Generation & Quality

- **Format**: All code blocks in Markdown must be fenced with triple backticks and include language (e.g., `python`, `sql`).
- **Modularity**: Modularize code for reusability. Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Imports**: Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow language-specific naming conventions. Use meaningful variable and function names.
- **Readability**: Prioritize simplicity, readability, maintainability. Choose simplest viable solution. Favor understandable code over clever tricks.
- **Comments**: Add clear, concise comments for complex logic. Include docstrings for functions, classes, modules.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with clear messages and safe fallback paths for all I/O and API calls.
- **Security**: Always consider security best practices. Never expose sensitive information in comments/logs. Store API keys/secrets as environment variables, not hardcoded.
- **Version Control**: Assume all project code is managed with Git. Generate `.gitignore` files appropriate for technologies. Adhere to commit message guidelines if provided in project rules.
- Frame solutions within broader architectural contexts and suggest design alternatives when appropriate.
- Highlight potential performance implications and optimization opportunities in suggested code.
- Favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code. Assume understanding of language idioms and design patterns.
- Maximize **algorithmic big-O efficiency**.

## 4. Testing & Reliability

- **Testability**: Design all code to be easily testable.
- **Unit Tests**: Always create Pytest unit tests for new features (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **Test Updates**: After updating any logic, check whether existing unit tests need updates. If so, perform them.
- **Testing Strategies**: Suggest comprehensive testing strategies (mocking, organization, coverage).
- **Test Location**: Tests should live in a `/tests` folder mirroring main app structure.
    - Include at least: 1 test for expected use, 1 edge case, 1 failure case.
- **Pre‑commit hooks**: `black`, `isort`, `detect-secrets`, `nbstripout`, `ruff`. Commits bypassing hooks are rejected by CI.

## 5. Workflow & Task Management

- **Task Protocol Adherence**: You **MUST** strictly adhere to the AI Task Management Protocol defined in the front matter of the `TASKS.md` file for the project you are working on. This protocol governs how tasks are identified, executed, and validated.
- **Task IDs**: Hierarchical dotted IDs `P<phase>.<workflow>.<task>` (e.g., `P2.1.4`).
- **Task Adherence**: Follow `TASKS.md` steps in order, unless instructed otherwise.
- **Progress Tracking**: After completing a `TASKS.md` task, immediately mark it complete (`[x]`).
- **Adding Discovered Tasks**: Add new sub-tasks or TODOs found during development to `TASK.md` under “Discovered During Work”.
- **Atomic Changes**: Make small, self-contained modifications. Avoid broad, exploratory edits.
- **Commit Messages**: When preparing a `git commit`, adhere to format `prefix: short description (max one sentence)`.


## 6. Documentation

- **Update `architecture.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Also keep `README.md`, `overview.md`, `PLANNING.md`, and `methods.md` in sync** with new or modified capabilities, file structure, features, etc. if these are discussed in the document.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

## 7. Tool Usage (General)

- **Strategic Selection**: Analyze codebase and user intent thoroughly before choosing tools. Select the most appropriate tool for each specific task.
- **Efficiency**: Plan to collect all necessary data in a single step to avoid multiple calls for the same information.
- **Error Checking**: Before using a tool, verify that all required parameters are available and correctly formatted. After execution, check the output for errors or unexpected results.
- **Tool Chaining**: When multiple tools are required, chain them logically. Use the output of one tool as the input for the next, ensuring a smooth workflow.

## 8. File System Operations

- **Path Management**: Use absolute paths for all file operations to avoid ambiguity. Construct paths using `os.path.join` or similar methods to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
- **File Safety**: Before writing to a file, check if it exists. If it does, confirm that overwriting is the intended action. Use temporary files for complex operations to prevent data loss.
- **Directory Management**: When creating directories, include logic to handle cases where the directory already exists.

## 9. Version Control (Git)

- **Branching**: Create a new feature branch for each distinct task. Use a clear and descriptive naming convention (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`).
- **Commits**: Make small, atomic commits with clear and concise messages that explain the *why* behind the change, not just the *what*.
- **Pull Requests**: When a feature is complete, open a pull request with a detailed description of the changes, linking to the relevant task or issue.

## 10. Final Output

- **Verification**: Before presenting the final output, perform a thorough self-review to ensure all requirements have been met, the code is clean, and the documentation is up-to-date.
- **Clarity**: Present the final output in a clear and organized manner, with a summary of the work completed and instructions for next steps.
