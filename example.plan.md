# Plan: Implement and Pass Tests for 00_setup_databases.py
tags: [testing, coding, python, pytest, database]
task_id: P1.W1.T4.1
description: A systematic plan to author, execute, and debug a suite of integration tests for the legacy database setup script, `00_setup_databases.py`.

## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory, especially `22_testing_standards.md`.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the specific requirements of task `P1.W1.T4.1`:
    - [ ] The test strategy section of the Phase 1 plan: `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#Testing-Strategy-for-00_setup_databases.py`.
    - [ ] The Python script that is the subject of the tests: `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/00_setup_databases.py`.

## Stage 2: Preparation & Test File Creation
- [ ] Create the new, empty test file which is the deliverable for this task: `tests/p1_w1/test_setup_databases.py`.
- [ ] In the new test file, import necessary libraries (`pytest`, `sqlalchemy`, `unittest.mock`).
- [ ] Add necessary `pytest` fixtures to manage database connections and mock the `config.ini` file for testing purposes. This ensures tests are isolated and do not depend on a live production configuration.

## Stage 3: Test Implementation & Debugging Loop
- [ ] **Implement Test Case 1: Successful Connection.** Write a `pytest` test that mocks the database configuration and asserts that the database connection function in `00_setup_databases.py` is called successfully.
- [ ] **Implement Test Case 2: Table Creation.** Write a test that connects to a clean test database, runs the main setup function, and then asserts that the expected tables (e.g., `tmp_df8."tblSSN"`) have been created.
- [ ] **Implement Test Case 3: Data Loading.** Write a test that, after running the setup function, asserts that a key table (e.g., `tmp_df8."tblSSN"`) contains a non-zero number of rows.
- [ ] **Implement Test Case 4: Graceful Failure.** Write a test that uses mocking to simulate a database connection error and asserts that the script handles the exception gracefully (e.g., logs an error and exits).
- [ ] **Execution & Debugging:** Run `pytest tests/p1_w1/test_setup_databases.py`. If any tests fail, analyze the errors, debug the test code or the source script (`00_setup_databases.py`) as needed, and re-run the tests. Repeat this loop until all tests pass.

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Verify that the `tests/p1_w1/test_setup_databases.py` file is populated with the implemented `pytest` tests and fixtures.
- [ ] Execute the final validation command as specified in `TASKS.md`: `pytest tests/p1_w1/test_setup_databases.py`. Confirm that the output shows all tests passing.
- [ ] Review all `validation_steps` for task `P1.W1.T4.1` in `TASKS.md` and confirm all criteria are met.
- [ ] Propose the required changes to `TASKS.md` to update the status of task `P1.W1.T4.1` to `done`.
