**Project:** Windsurf Instructional Memory Architecture (IMA) Enhancement - Phases 1-3

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Project Roadmap outlines the strategic plan and timeline for implementing Phases 1, 2, and 3 of the Windsurf Instructional Memory Architecture (IMA) enhancement project. It serves as a high-level guide for the Cascade AI agent and human developers, detailing the sequence of development, key milestones, and dependencies. This document translates the objectives from `NEW_PATH_FORWARD.md` and the technical specifications from `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md` and `windsurf_project_architecture.md` into a phased execution strategy.

### 1.2 Goals
*   Provide a clear, sequential overview of the project's development lifecycle for Phases 1-3.
*   Define key deliverables and milestones for each phase.
*   Identify critical dependencies between tasks and phases.
*   Facilitate project tracking and progress monitoring.
*   Ensure alignment with the overall strategic vision and technical architecture.

### 1.3 Scope
This roadmap covers all activities required to complete Phases 1, 2, and 3 of the IMA enhancement, as detailed in `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md`. This includes development, testing, documentation, and integration of all specified features and tools.

## 2. Overall Project Timeline & Phasing

The project is divided into three primary phases, designed for incremental development and value delivery. Each phase builds upon the previous one, culminating in a significantly enhanced IMA.

*   **Phase 1: Foundation Hardening** (Estimated Duration: [e.g., 2-3 Sprints / 4-6 Weeks])
    *   Focus: Establishing core stability, automation, and standardized protocols.
*   **Phase 2: Memory & Context Optimization** (Estimated Duration: [e.g., 3-4 Sprints / 6-8 Weeks])
    *   Focus: Enhancing knowledge management, retrieval, and context relevance.
*   **Phase 3: Developer Experience & Usability** (Estimated Duration: [e.g., 2-3 Sprints / 4-6 Weeks])
    *   Focus: Improving accessibility, integration, and overall ease of use for developers.

## 3. Phase 1: Foundation Hardening - Roadmap

**Objective:** Solidify the IMA's core architecture, automate validation, formalize operational protocols, and improve initial DX.

## 8. Risk Management

| Risk                                      | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Underestimation of Task Complexity**    | Break down tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Regular progress reviews and re-estimation if needed. Prioritize core functionality.       |
| **Tooling Integration Challenges**        | Incremental development and testing of CLI tools and IDE integrations. Start with basic functionality and iterate. Allocate time for debugging. |
| **Scope Creep**                           | Strict adherence to the defined scope in `Unified Optimization Blueprint v2.md` and this roadmap. Formal change request process for any deviations. |
| **Documentation Gaps**                    | Continuous documentation alongside development. Automated documentation generation helps keep it current. Peer reviews of documentation.         |

## 9. Communication Plan

*   **Progress Tracking:** Via `TASKS.md` updates and regular status reports (e.g., weekly summaries).
*   **Issue Management:** GitHub Issues for bugs, feature requests, and discussions.
*   **Key Decisions:** Documented in relevant planning files or meeting notes within the `.windsurf/planning/` directory.

## 10. Next Steps (Post Phase 3)

Upon successful completion of Phases 1-3, the project will be ready for:
*   Consideration of Phase 4: Security, Governance & Advanced Features.
*   Broader rollout and adoption by more development teams.
*   Continuous monitoring and gathering of feedback for future iterations and improvements.
